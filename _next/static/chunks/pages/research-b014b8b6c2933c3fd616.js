The first approach uses a generative model of synthetic saccade patterns to represent the baseline scan-path from a typical non-ASD individual and combines it with the real scan-path as well as other auxiliary data as inputs to a deep learning classifier. The second approach adopts a more holistic image-based approach by feeding the input image and a sequence of fixation maps into a convolutional or recurrent neural network.",image:"/assets/images/prash-ASD-gaze.png",imageAlt:"Third feature alt text",href:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923596521000357#aep-article-footnote-id1",target:"_blank",reverse:!0}),(0,i.jsx)(c.t,{title:"Generative Adversarial Framework for Eye Image Synthesis and Gaze Estimation",description:"Eye Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks: Researched and developed models to generate synthetic  eye  images  for  data  augmentation  using  Deep  Convolutional  GANs  and  analysed  the  performance  of  the DCGAN using a custom metric based on categorical cross entropy loss produced on a pre-trained classifier to quantify the realness of the generated data.",image:"/assets/images/prash_sample-images-crop.gif",imageAlt:"First feature alt text",href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EsVt26cu_6SYCiyLcNBucmRdOPORtQOo/view?usp=sharing",target:"_blank",reverse:!0}),(0,i.jsx)(c.t,{title:"Gaze Direction Tracking in Infants",description:"Development of Convolutional Neural Network based machine learning models for predicting eye-gaze direction.
